# Ray Tracing and OpenGL Graphics Pipeline Projects

## Overview
Here are two distinct projects I've worked on, focusing on different aspects of 3D graphics rendering, all part of my adventures in CS130 Computer Graphics.

### Ray Tracing Project
The first project is a ray tracing framework designed for rendering scenes with high realism. It simulates the interactions of light with geometric primitives, with a specific focus on spheres. This project emphasizes the creation of realistic lighting effects through advanced shading techniques, including Lambertian and Phong shading, and features such as reflections, refractions, and procedural textures.

### OpenGL Clone Graphics Pipeline Project
The second project simulates a simplified OpenGL-like graphics pipeline, aimed at accurately rendering 3D scenes through a series of computational stages. This simulation covers essential rendering techniques, including vertex and fragment shading, rasterization, interpolation, and clipping. 

## Features

### Ray Tracing Features
- Advanced Shading: Utilizes Lambertian and Phong shading models for realistic lighting.
- Complex Lighting and Shadows: Implements dynamic shadows and lighting calculations.
- Reflections and Refractions: Applies the principles of the angle of incidence and Snell's Law for realistic light interactions.
- Super Sampling (Anti-aliasing) and Depth of Field: Enhances image quality and simulates camera focus effects.
- Texture Mapping and UV Coordinates: Integrates texture mapping with UV coordinates for mesh objects, significantly enhancing the visual detail and realism of rendered scenes.
- Optimization Strategies: Employs bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) for spatial optimization and efficient shadow ray casting, ensuring high-performance rendering in complex scenes. 

### OpenGL Clone Pipeline Features
- Vertex and Fragment Shading: Performs shading operations at different stages of the pipeline.
- Rasterization and Interpolation: Converts primitives into raster images with interpolated attributes.
- Clipping and Z-Buffering: Ensures efficient and accurate rendering of scenes within the view volume.
